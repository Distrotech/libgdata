{"name":"Libgdata","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.gnome.org/libgdata","body":"libgdata\r\n========\r\n\r\nlibgdata is a GLib-based library for accessing online service APIs using the\r\nGData protocol --- most notably, Google's services. It provides APIs to access\r\nthe common Google services, and has full asynchronous support.\r\n\r\nSee the test programs in gdata/tests/ for simple examples of how to use the\r\ncode.\r\n\r\nlibgdata's API is currently unstable and is likely to change wildly.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n============\r\n\r\n • glib-2.0 ≥ 2.31.0\r\n • libxml-2.0\r\n • gio-2.0 ≥ 2.17.3\r\n • libsoup-2.4 ≥ 2.37.91\r\n • liboauth ≥ 0.9.4\r\n\r\nIf compiling with --enable-gnome (for GNOME support):\r\n • libsoup-gnome-2.4\r\n • gcr-base-3\r\n • goa-1.0 ≥ 3.2\r\n\r\nIf compiling the demos:\r\n • gtk+-3.0 ≥ 2.91.2\r\n\r\nEnvironment variables\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nIf the environment variable LIBGDATA_DEBUG is set to one of the following\r\nvalues, libgdata will give debug output (at various levels):\r\n 0: Output no debug messages or network logs\r\n 1: Output debug messages, but not network logs\r\n 2: Output debug messages and network traffic headers\r\n 3: Output debug messages and full network traffic logs, redacting usernames,\r\n    passwords and auth. tokens\r\n 4: Output debug messages and full network traffic logs, and don't redact\r\n    usernames, passwords and auth. tokens\r\nIf LIBGDATA_DEBUG is unset, no debug output will be produced.\r\n\r\nSo, to debug a program which uses libgdata, run it from a terminal with the\r\nfollowing command:\r\n\r\n$ LIBGDATA_DEBUG=3 ./my-program-name &> libgdata.log\r\n\r\nDeprecation guards\r\n==================\r\n\r\nIf LIBGDATA_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is defined when compiling against libgdata, all\r\ndeprecated API will be removed from included headers.\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n=========\r\n\r\nlibgdata is licensed under the LGPL; see COPYING.LIB for more details.\r\n\r\nContact\r\n=======\r\n\r\nPhilip Withnall <philip@tecnocode.co.uk>\r\nhttp://live.gnome.org/libgdata\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
